Welcome to the first-ever STEM server poem competition. You will be competing against one another, creating poems you think the server will love. Unleash your inner creativity, your inner Shakespeare, your inner writer, or submit just for fun for a chance to receive the @events winner role! 

__Theme:__ The theme for our first poem competition will remain open-ended. That being said, you have the freedom to write about anything your heart desires in a format that suits your topic best. For reference, some popular poem forms include limerick, acrostic, couplet, Shakespearian sonnet, haiku, and villanelle.  

__Additional Requirements:__ We recommend participants to aim for a maximum of 150 words in length. As long as your piece remains within the 150 word limit, the total amount of lines are adjustable to meet your chosen poem structure.

__Submission method:__ During the period of the competition, you will be able to upload submissions through the https://stem.help/event website. Here you will be asked to login using an individualized token which can be received by dming STEM.HELP (@visit stem.help) with "!token". All poem submissions will be screened [or reviewed] by the staff before being allowed to enter the competition.

> Note: you may only submit one poem in total

__Judging method:__ Following the screening process once the submission time is over, the poems will be published and displayed anonymously in the #poem-competition channel. All interested server members will be pinged and notified once the voting period commences via the #announcements channel. The method of voting will be made clear once the submission time is over. The winners will be decided based upon the most popular vote. Make sure you pick your favourite piece!

__Rules and Guidelines:__ 
- Only 1 submission per individual is allowed. If you submit more than once, only the last submission will be considered. 
- NFSW content is strictly prohibited and it is preferred that you avoid making any inflammatory submissions.
- Any pieces of poetry submitted after the deadline or through other means than stem.help/poems will not be considered.
- No plagiarism is allowed. Only original content will be considered in the voting process.
- Vote fraud (voting for yourself or someone else using an alternate account) is prohibited and will result in elimination from the competition.

__Prize__:
