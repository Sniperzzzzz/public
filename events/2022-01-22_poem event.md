Welcome to the first ever STEM server poem competition. You will be competing against one another, creating poems you think the server will love. Unleash your inner creativity or submit just for fun for a chance to receive the @events winner role! 

__Theme:__ The theme for our first poem competition will remain open-ended. That being said, you have the freedom to write about anything your heart desires in a format that suits your topic best. For reference, some popular poem forms include limerick, acrostic, couplet, Shakespearian sonnet, haiku, and villanelle.  

__Submission method:__ During the period of the competition, you will be able to dm @Schwii with your memes and use the submit poem command. These poems will be first screened by the staff before being allowed to enter the competition.

> Note: you may only submit one poem in total

__Judging method:__ Following the screening process once the submission time is over, the poems will be published and displayed anonymously in the #poem-competition channel. All server members will be pinged and notified once the voting period commences. The method of voting will be made clear once the submission time is over. The winners will be decided based upon the most popular vote. Make sure you pick your favourite piece!
