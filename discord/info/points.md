# **STEM Point System**

## |== **What Are Thanks and How Do I Get Them?** ==|
Thanks are automatically granted "points" that are given to people that help on help channels by the people they help. 

### **How do I get/give thanks?**  
First off, read [How to ask](./howtoask.md)  

After someone helps you, in order to give them thanks, send a message with one of these words in it: "Thank/s", "ty", "Thnx", "Thx", "Tnx", "Tysm", "Tyvm", "Danke"

+ If no one was mentioned in your message, and it wasn't a reply, you will be sent an embed that looks something like:

    **Select who the thank is aimed towards**  
    **1 ‚ùØ** `@üçí nop | CEO of hell üçí`    
    **2 ‚ùØ** `@Remceau`  
    **3 ‚ùØ** `@Hell‚Äôs Rick Astley (Don‚Äôt DM)`    
    **4 ‚ùØ** `@Tim Werbenjagermanjenson`  

    Under this embed will be 4 reactions: **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, and <img src="./images/delete_symbol.png" width="15" height="15">. You should react with the number that corresponds to the person who helped you, or <img src="./images/delete_symbol.png" width="15" height="15"> if it was a mistake.

    

+ If someone was tagged in your message, or it was a reply, they will be given the thanks straight away without any embed prompt. Using this method you can thank multiple people at once.

**DO NOT abuse the thank system, as it may result in the revokal of your ability to thank and/or mention helpers.** Abuse includes, but is not limited to: spam thanking, thanking without reason.

### **How are thank points calculated?**  
Thank points are the sum of your weekly thanks (thanks granted to you since the start of the week) and your alltime thanks (thanks granted to you since you joined the server).  
For example, if you joined this week, and already have helped 10 people, and they all thanked you, your points will be 20 (10 weekly thanks + 10 alltime thanks).  
Weekly thank points are reset at midnight on monday, GMT time.

## |== **What Are Thank Points For?** ==|  
Thank points help create a educational competitive enviornment which leads helpers to strive to help as many people as they can. 
Top helpers are given color roles, and are displayed seperately from other members.  
The top helper roles are as follows (from [faq](./faq.md#q-how-are-the-top-helper-roles-distributed)):  

‚ùØ `@Top Helper ‚àû`: Given to the all-time top helper 

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Œ©`: Given to the weekly top helper 

The remaining three are given to members with atleast a weekly thank count of:

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Œ≥`: 3% of the weekly top helper count

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Œ≤`: 25% of the weekly top helper count

‚ùØ `@Top Helper Œ±`: 70% of the weekly top helper count

The `Top Helper (Subject)` Roles are distributed if you have 50% of the top helper count in that respective subject!

(Members with `@Top Helper ‚àû` and `@Top Helper Œ©` can change the color of their role with !hex [hex code])
