**__Quick Access Guide__**

**What is the Quick Access Category?**
The Quick Access category is a convenient new tool for helpers to locate new questions being asked. This makes questions more easy to find and identify which questions have already been resolved. They are currently categorized into 5 main channels: <#914855548019695648>, <#914868705043836938>, <#914869061387714580>, <#914868892822802452>, and <#914869233232519219>.

**How do I use the Quick Access Channels?**
Opening any of the channels under the Quick Access category will show helpers a list of questions that have or have yet to be answered. The **Open question** button underneath the question will navigate you to the question. Alternatively, the **View thread** button will navigate helpers to a private thread where assistance can be provided.

Upon receiving a thank point, <@!736917954209251419> will automatically mark the question as resolved in the respective channel. However, individuals with a top helper role can also manually mark questions as resolved using the **UNSOLVED (mark solved)** button underneath the question.

**Note for Math Mods**
If you have the Math mod role, you have permissions to be able to categorize math questions by topic in <#914855548019695648>. This can be done using the dropdown menu (**Select questions topic**). Questions are to be categorized as either:
Algebra
Geometry
Probability and statistics
Trigonometry
Precalculus or calculus
Advanced Calculus
Linear Algebra
None of the above

If you are able to categorize math problems by topic, you qualify to be a math mod. Ask a staff member about this for more details.
