# Want some help with homework or other STEM-related problems? Follow this [`#how-to-ask`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/625027300920000542) guide.

## How to ask questions:

### 1. Pick the right channel.
Use common sense to pick the most suitable topic channel for your problem. If you're unsure which channel to use, **post in the channel you think is most appropriate** and people from the server will direct you to the right channel if needed. **Don't post you questions to [`#general`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/839399426643591188).** This channel is for casual STEM discussions.

**Post your question in the correct channel** from the above categories.

------

### 2. Describe your problem thoroughly.
Don't "[ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)" &mdash; that is, make sure your message contains a **detailed description of your problem**. If your question is simply "Can someone help me?", it will be ignored most of the time; none of the helpers will pay attention to a **short, vague description of a problem**. A good, well-formulated question will include all relevant details and assist the helper by giving any previously acquired information or information you, yourself, have worked out.

> You may post a picture of your problem if you want, but make sure it has good lighting and is oriented correctly. If the image contains multiple problems, specify which problem you need help with. See [here](https://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html) for more guidance.

#### Examples of good questions
```
* I've been asked to solve 5x^2 + 25x + 100 = 0 by completing the square - how would I start to do this?
* Could someone please remind me on how to get the determinant of 2x2 matrix. I need it for a linear algebra assignment.
```

------

### 3. State what you don't understand about the question and which approaches you have already tried.
Our helpers will try their best to help you learn, but to do so we first need to know what you already know and what you don't yet know. This helps us identify which areas you need more help on and which areas you are already able to deal with competently. When a helper helps you, please pay attention &mdash; **just because they are guiding you through a question does not mean you can ignore them and then copy the answer at the end.**

#### Examples of questions with good explanations
```
* Hi! Could anyone guide me on how to differentiate this function: sqrt(x^2 - 1) + 5x^7. I'm trying to do it using chain rule but I can't seem to be able to apply it properly.
* What is the difference between a Taylor Polynomial and Maclaurin Polynomial, I tried googling but nothing makes sense.
```

------

### 4. Ping the right role *after* you post your question.
You can ping one of the helper roles. For example, if you need help with computer science, you can ping the `@Computer Science Helpers` role. Someone will eventually come by and help you. Don't ping anyone else &mdash; this includes random online users and `@everyone`.

Roles available for pinging:

- `@Math Helpers`
- `@Advanced/Uni Math Helpers`
- `@Physics Helpers`
- `@Chemistry Helpers`
- `@Biology Helpers`
- `@Engineering Helpers`
- `@Computer Science Helpers`
- `@Coding/Programming Helpers`
- `@Artificial intelligence and machine learning Helper`
- `@Tech Support Helper`

**Please ping the helper roles in their corresponding channels only.**

------

### 5. Do not post in multiple channels.
Instead, patiently wait for someone to help you, and be respectful when they do. **All STEM helpers are volunteers;** if they're taking time out of their day to help you, the least you can do is be nice to them. When they have finished helping, be sure to drop them a thank &mdash; they've gone out of their way just to help you!

------

**(Do not DM Helpers.)**
