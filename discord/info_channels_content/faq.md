## Q: How are the Top Helper Roles distributed?

❯ `@Top Helper ∞`: Given to the all-time top helper 

❯ `@Top Helper Ω`: Given to the weekly top helper 

The remaining three are given to members with atleast a weekly thank count of:

❯ `@Top Helper γ`: 3% of the weekly top helper count

❯ `@Top Helper β`: 25% of the weekly top helper count

❯ `@Top Helper α`: 70% of the weekly top helper count

(Members with @Top Helper ∞ and @Top Helper Ω can change the color of their role with `!hex [hex code]`)

## Q: How do I use `@Tex`?

❯ `@Tex` is a high quality LaTeX rendering and maths bot. We mainly use it to render beautiful maths in LaTeX or interact with Wolfram Alpha. Check this out for detailed commands for Latex: [LaTeX help](https://www.ntg.nl/doc/biemesderfer/ltxcrib.pdf)

❯ `@Tex` will render anything you put between two dollar signs `${math stuff}$` in latex (example: `This is normal text and $\frac{x}{2}$ was a beautiful fraction in Latex`). 

❯ To get you started, here's a quick overview of the most used syntax:

`\frac{numerator}{denominator}`

`{base}^{things in the exponent}`

`\sqrt{things inside the squre root}`

`\sqrt[n]{things inside the nth root}`

`\text{things you wanna render as plain text rather than as an equation}`

`\ln`, `\log_{base}`

`\sin`, `\cos`, `\tan`

`\alpha`, `\beta`, `\pi`, `\Theta`

`\times`, `\cdot` for multiplication symbol and multiplication dot respectively

`,w` followed by a math query to help to get a response from WolframAlpha (example: `,w integral of x^x^x`)

`,calc` followed by a math expression works like a basic calculator (example: `,calc 25*86`)

❯ There are many people in the server who are really good with LaTeX and the bot in general (there are fun commands too :)), you are always welcome to ask us for help! To end this off on a positive note, you'll learn more by just trying out things yourself, so don't be afraid to let your curiosity flow in [`#commands`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/691983378089771079) or [`#spam!`](https://discord.com/channels/493173110799859713/753617965823295546)

## Q: How do you get a colored role

❯ In order to get a color of your choice, you have to boost the server or win an event!

❯ Once you boost the server, use !color to get a list of colors available to pick from. If a color role is not listed, you may ask an `@Administrator`, `@Moderator` or `@Mini Mod` to make one for you (exceptions to the colors are the colors identical to: `@Red` and `@Muted`)

❯ The second way to get a color role is by winning a server wide event. We don't do events too often but if you do catch one and win it, you will be given the `@Event Winner 🏆` role, which will allow you to use the same command to change your color.

## Q: What is `@𝕍𝖆𝖑𝖚𝖊𝕕` and how do you get Valued?

❯ `@𝕍𝖆𝖑𝖚𝖊𝕕` is given to those who are generally a good influence, don't break rules (i.e. have a relatively clear record), have been in the server for some time, and are the people who others can look up to.

❯ It is often believed that having more thank points will result in `@𝕍𝖆𝖑𝖚𝖊𝕕`, however, the role has little to nothing to do with thank points.

## Q: Can I apply for mod?

❯ Short Answer: No

❯ Long answer: Thank you for your interest in being a moderator for this server! Unfortunately, we don't do applications. When in need of more moderators, we will select members for trial-mod (`@Mini Mod`), that we think would be the best fit (generally nice, relatively active, relatively clean record, would be good at enforcing rules etc.)

❯ Members constantly asking to be a mod (i.e. craving mod) are the least likely to be offered the position.

❯ New moderators are usually picked from `@𝕍𝖆𝖑𝖚𝖊𝕕`.

## Q: Can I get `@STEM` in my server?

❯ Unfortunately, not at the moment. the STEM Bot is a bot that is managed by our server admins, and it is currently only reserved for this server. 

❯ If you have other general questions about other discord bots, or possibly coding your own, feel free to ask for help or suggestions in the server :)

## Can I get help?

❯ [Don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/), just ask!

❯ Here's a general guideline to follow when asking for help:
- Pick an appropriate channel (i.e. not being currently used and is related to the subject)
- Post your question mentioning all the details
- Ping the appropriate helper role for your question (`@Helper > Math`, `@Helper > Physics`, `@Helper > Chemistry`, `@Helper > Biology`, `@Helper > Coding`, `@Helper > CS`, `@Helper > Coding`)

❯ For detailed instructions and information, read `#how-to-ask`
